## Current Takeaways

- Keep the original 4,000-step baseline as the current submission checkpoint because it is the best controlled seed-99 result.
- The prompt comparison improved success from 35% to 55%, showing that language conditioning affects the action policy.
- The effective 8,000-step control dropped from 55% to 40%, showing that more training steps and loss tracking alone are not reliable optimization targets.
- The second seed dropped to 5%, so the project should disclose high evaluation variance and avoid overstating robustness.
- The targeted-only fine-tune also dropped to 5%, which suggests hard-case data should be mixed with replay from the original broad dataset rather than replacing it.
- The paired camera ablation measured 42% with both views, 10% overhead-only, and 2% wrist-only; the current policy relies on complementary views.
- The exact 2:1 mixed replay candidate used 80 broad plus 40 targeted episodes, but scored 20% on the paired 50-episode set and was rejected.
- The robustness matrix measured 50% nominal, 20% under camera dropout, 20% under local occlusion, 40% under two-step delay, and 40% under low friction.
- The uncertainty probe completed 3/10 with zero threshold crossings at `0.03`; it remains a diagnostic interface, not a demonstrated recovery gain.

## Decision

The original 4,000-step checkpoint remains the submission model. The targeted
data generation, exact 2:1 mixed replay, camera ablation, robustness matrix,
and uncertainty probe are completed and recorded. The next model iteration
should train with camera-dropout augmentation and use a held-out paired
manifest; no such retrained checkpoint is claimed in this submission.

## Reproducibility Status (2026-08-05)

Completed in the repository:

- Added deterministic brightness and RGB sensor-noise perturbations to data
  generation and custom-scene evaluation.
- Added `both`, `overhead_only`, and `wrist_only` camera ablation modes.
- Added fixed evaluation manifests for paired 50-episode comparisons.
- Added failure-coordinate targeted placement manifests with deterministic
  jitter.
- Added a LeRobot mixed replay dataset builder with schema checks.
- Added a LeRobot dataset protocol validator.
- Added optional TensorBoard event logging to the training script.
- Added Wilson confidence intervals to generated evaluation summaries.
- Added `docs/sim_to_real.md` and `submission/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md`.

Completed on the ROCm cloud runtime:

1. Generated the fixed 50-episode manifests and ran all three camera conditions.
2. Generated and validated targeted data, built the exact 2:1 mixed dataset,
   and trained the conservative candidate.
3. Evaluated the candidate on the paired manifest and a second-seed subset.
4. Ran the baseline robustness matrix and copied JSON, CSV, Markdown, and SVG
   evidence into the repository.

Remaining submission action: upload the final local video and replace the
public video URL placeholder after YouTube or Bilibili publication.

The original 4,000-step checkpoint remains the submission fallback until a
new candidate beats it on a paired evaluation set without hiding the
seed-123 negative control.
