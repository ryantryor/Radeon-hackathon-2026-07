# Final Submission Checklist

This checklist separates repository work from the few actions that must be
completed in the contest portal or video platform.

## Repository: ready

- [x] Public GitHub fork and project folder: `radeon-kitchen-smolvla`
- [x] Bilingual README with project summary, development process, code sources,
      team, installation, running commands, results, limitations, and license
- [x] Source code and reproducible data/training/evaluation scripts
- [x] Experiment comparison table with prompt, training-step, second-seed, and
      targeted-only controls
- [x] Failure-coordinate analysis and scatter plot
- [x] Technical report and Sim-to-Real risk analysis
- [x] AMD ROCm usage documented
- [x] Large datasets, model weights, and videos excluded from Git
- [x] Current best submission checkpoint documented as the original 4,000-step
      baseline, 11/20 = 55% on seed 99
- [x] Video script shortened to no more than 3 minutes

## Contest portal: user action required

- [ ] Confirm every team member has registered for the AMD AI Developer Plan

      `Chen Weiliang`
- [ ] Paste the public GitHub project URL into the submission form

- [ ] Submit before 2026-08-06 23:59 Beijing time, as stated in the contest notice
- [ ] Keep the final submission form, PR title/body, and supporting text in English
      where the starter repository requires English; keep the README bilingual

## Video: user action required

- [x] Export at 1080p or higher and keep the duration at or below 3 minutes
- [x] Open with a successful pick within the first 5 seconds
- [x] Show one success, one failure, the result table, and the failure plot
- [x] Add bilingual subtitles or bilingual on-screen labels
- [x] End on the GitHub URL, team name, and track
- [ ] Upload publicly to YouTube or Bilibili
- [x] Keep the original exported video as a backup

The current local render is
`videos/radeon_kitchen_smolvla_final_demo_intensity_sweep.mp4` (132.08 seconds,
1920x1080). Its stress comparison records the actual perturbed policy inputs,
so the 40% occlusion is visible in both bottom-row camera panels.

The repository currently uses `TBD` for the public video URL until the upload
is completed. No fabricated URL should be submitted.
